# handtracker

This is a handtracker app that plays a sound whenever the camera detects a hand. 
This was made following the video here <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s66w28knp80&list=PLXuPlLG7Z3CCuwbVpspki0kXUPN_cR_r-&index=7">Build A Hand Detection App Tutorial</a>.
This uses <a href="https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js/
">handtrack.js</a> to track the hand through video.
